This script was custom-made for a client, which means that not every weapon/ammo-related feature has been added to the script. However, if a feature is requested and I have time, I could add it in an update.

I'll try to help with issues and problems as much as I can if these arise.
If you have any suggestions, ideas, or improvements then please let me know!

Removes the reloading logic from GTA and replaces it with a more realistic way of reloading weapons. 
To reload your weapon, the keybind is "**R**" on the keyboard.

**Features**
* Maximum ammunition is the size of the clip size.
* Reloading only works if you possess a specific item in your inventory (only ESX).
* You cannot reload if your clip size is full.
* One reload equals the maximum amount of ammunition in the clip size.

**Usage**
 * Idle: **0.01ms**.
 * While holding a weapon (not melee): **0.03-0.04ms**.
